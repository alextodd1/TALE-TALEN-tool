TALE Pair Finder
TALE Pair Finder is a Flask-based web tool designed to identify potential Transcription Activator-Like Effector (TALE) binding sites within a given DNA sequence. This tool implements an algorithm to locate TALE pairs that meet specific criteria.
Features

Identifies potential TALE binding sites in DNA sequences
Applies various filtering criteria including CpG island detection, consecutive A/T base checking, GC content calculation, and strong RVD counting
Allows for customizable TALE and spacer length ranges
Provides a web interface for easy use and result visualization
